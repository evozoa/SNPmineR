# SNPmineR
An R package to identify DNA variants across species based on positional orthology to human SNP input

# SNPmineR

**SNPmineR** is an R package under development that allows users to search for orthologous nonsynonymous mitochondrial SNPs across species using a known human mtDNA variant as input. This tool supports translational model selection and evolutionary analysis of mitonuclear interactions.

## Key Features
- Cross-species search for orthologous mtDNA variants
- Prediction of amino acid substitutions at disease-relevant loci
- Support for vertebrate mitogenomes
- Integration with Biostrings and msa packages

## Development Status
This package is under active development. Current goals include:
- Core sequence alignment and variant mapping functionality
- Orthology-based filtering
- SAAP (Structural Analysis of Amino Acid Properties) support

## Citation
If you use SNPmineR in your work, please cite the relevant preprint or publication (in preparation).
